                Designing for Immersion was a course facilitated by <a href= "https://wittywit.com/" style="color: rgb(123, 119, 150)">Pranshu</a> at University, it opened up multiple inquiries that I’m continuing to ponder upon.</h2>

            <h2>Strictly two-dimensional media, such as photographs, exhibit an object-like quality because they can be viewed from different distances and angles. For instance, a photo occupies only a part of the field of vision when held. Images can also be placed on the inside faces of a cube, surrounding the viewer’s sight. However, when transitioning from a cube to a sphere, images start to warp, presenting challenges to maintaining their two-dimensionality. Despite the image itself being 2-D, it needs to be manipulated in 3-D space to be mapped onto a curved surface, requiring consideration of three dimensions to fully utilize the space.  </h2>

                In 3-Dimensional space, primary extensions of activity involve looking and walking around. 
                If you look around yourself now, you might find corners and edges formed by walls or an open sky where trees and buildings slowly diminish in scale.

            <h2>
                Effectively communicating stories relies on a multitude of factors. To keep an audience engaged, a plot must be clear in its use of language, poetics, and logic alongside its tangible delivery.
                  </h2>
            <h2> Imagine entering a 3-D space, like in software such as Blender, or stepping into a television, similar to Mike in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. In this case, storytelling can be viewed through the lens of phenomenology, where the observer actively participates in the story, becoming as much a part of it as any other element.</h2>

                <h2>A key difference between a photograph and a 3-D environment is that, in a photograph, the story is presented to the viewer, while in a 3-D space, the story unfolds as the viewer experiences it. My early attempts at storytelling in this medium focused on leveraging the immediacy and "presentness" that 3-D spaces offer.

            <h2>I wanted to develop the premise with relatively blurred boundaries between the introduction, conflict, and resolution. This was done to trigger associations and seek for interpretations more effectively. </h2>

            <h2>Immersive media has traditionally been used for gamified experiences. We're at a juncture where makers are now focusing on designing experiences for everyday tasks with the medium. Although, it has rapidly evolved to symbolise a form of gaming experience. Preserving that symbology, this narrative too accomodated a form of gamification without any real victory conditions. </h2>

            <h2>The physical hardware that facilitates this experiment is a head-mounted gear. HMDs bring a unique character in terms of interaction. They are adamant extensions of our vision which is the dominant sense for a proportion of the population. I chose to observe the physicality of HMDs as an augmentation of thought more than a physical transportation in space.  </h2>

            <h2>By the virtue of one's ability to move around freely, this narrative could not have a precise sequence. It has to make sense through all combinations possible. However, this approach requires greater understanding, fidelity of storytelling and contemplation on questions like,<br>How do we navigate spaces without direction?
                <br>   How can navigation be facilitated in an infinite space?
                <br>    How do we arrange elements in space to establish directionality? </h2>

            <h2 id="sidenote">My approach to the narrative eventually evolved from a fascination to a ‘want to experience’. I wanted to address more fundamental steps before I take the leap towards a larger story.</h2>

            <h1 id="sub">Staging and Choreographing</h1>
            <h2>Another school of thought I like to borrow from while 'designing' experiences in general is performance arts. <br> How does the nature of staging shape meanings of the elements being staged? <br> The act of staging is an extension of expression that is planned and performed. There are various principles, guidelines and rules of thumb concerned with different forms of performance arts. If we treat the experience in 3-D space as a performance, how do we then arrange and time the elements to convey the narrative?
            </h2>

        <h2>While ideating using principles from the performance arts domain, the visual manifestation of these ideas reminded me of some deeply personal pursuits leading to an exploration of blogs in 3-D space.  
        </h2>

        <h1 id="sub">What could a blog ‘feel’ like in a spatial medium?</h1>

        <h2>Blogs are extensions of one’s experience expressed in words and etched in time on the internet. These expressions often are a means of communicating with the world, letting go of an idea and so forth. The relationship one shares with the practice of blogging is forged by a sense of yearning and liveliness. Their positioning in a ‘present’ social context and ‘personal’ nature 'layered' with complete visual and auditory engagement could lead to new forms of meaning-making and perceptions associated with blogs. 
        </h2>

        <h2>The short blog below formed the crux of the first idea for this experiment.

        <h2>This experiment took a rather craft-like approach, deconstructing complexities as they unfolded in all directions. Perhaps, this method of 'technique-narrative coupling' or 'affordance-association coupling' is something I'd like to ponder upon and tinker with to its boundaries in projects lying ahead. As for the call to wonder, regarding 'spatial blogs' themselves, I continue to think about qualities of written text, language and how we interact with them as foundations of spawning ideas. Notions of shared blog spaces and associative contexts provide more opportunities to push contemplation.
